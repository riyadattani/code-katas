The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as
the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances;
but it lacked somewhat of the true gush, for the poor
fellow’s instinct taught him that there was a mystery
here that could not well bear the light, perhaps; it was
simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises a
dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt.

Amy Lawrence was proud and glad, and she tried to make Tom
see it in her face—but he wouldn’t look. She wondered;
then she was just a grain troubled; next a dim suspicion
came and went—came again; she watched; a furtive glance
told her worlds—and then her heart broke, and she was
jealous, and angry, and the tears came and she hated
everybody. Tom most of all (she thought).
